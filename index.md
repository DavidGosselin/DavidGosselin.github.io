## Legacy Codebase Risk Management and Team Optimization

An expert in delivering compound value in tough legacy environments.  Articulate technical leader capable of solving problems at the intersection of mathematics, computer, and data science using tools developed in languages like C++, Python, Java, and R.

I enjoy building teams and cultivating workplace relationships because we're all successful when we work better together.

### Legacy Codebase Risk Management

I specialize in derisking legacy codebases by increasing engineering team understanding through code coverage metrics, testing, and collaboration.  An expert in balancing software enhancement go-to-market needs against technical debt, I bring  test-driven development and sound engineering practices to bear on project requirements.  I devise sound software solutions under tight constraints and in a clear and maintainable way, with robust documentation, that management and stakeholders can get behind.

### Team Relationship Optimization

Successful in coaching team members with intrapersonal communication skills like listening, empathy, and patience, without introducing new or unnecessary processes.  Skilled in casting vision to unify divided or frequently clashing teammates.  Articulate at all levels of the engineering organization, capable of bringing together disparate parties to advance projects forward.  I free engineers to think bigger by encouraging them to own results instead of implementations.
