### About David Gosselin

A fifteen year veteran of the software industry, I love to tackle tough systems problems in large, fielded codebases
by getting my hands dirty.  At the same time, I love to lead others in developing their skills in reading and understanding
code they haven't written while adding value through instrumentation, testing, and ROI-driven refactoring.

I've worked across diverse industry verticals, starting in defense, moving to telecommunications, computer networks, and database technologies,
with a highly successful track record.  I've served as a Technical Lead over two teams comprising of fourteen individuals as well
as an individual contributor at the Senior Principal and Principal levels.

When I'm not coding, I faithfully serve the homeless population in my area, both by meeting them where they are on the street
and through the Southern New Hampshire Rescue Mission ( [nashuarescuemission.org](https://nashuarescuemission.org) ), of which I'm a board member.

I was educated at the University of Maine and hold both a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Mathematics, graduating from
the Honors College with High Honors.  I was a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the international honor society for the computer and
information disciplines.
